            "content": "Create Stock Price Indicator Dashboard in Power BI . toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true | author: Ijeoma Odoko | categories: [python, power bi, jupyter] | . About . The purpose of this project is to create a dataframe capturing stock price data and calculating indicator values using Python, and then visualize it in Power BI in a simple dashboard. . Key steps taken include: . Create the virtual environment for Windows in Anaconda. | Download the required libraries, and the stock price and volume data from yahoo finance using the pandas_datareader python API into a pandas dataframe. | Calculate the stock indicator values using the TA-lib Python library. Use the Pandas Library if function not available in TA-lib. | Convert the dataframe(s) to csv files to use in Power BI. | Create dashboard with the indicator values in Power BI. | Step 1: Create the Virtual Environment for Windows in Anaconda . Create a new python 3.7 environment in Anaconda. Reference this cheatsheet. . Download the TA-Lib wrapper from here. To choose the right one you need to know the python version in your environment, and computer’s operating system (32bit or 64bit). . Move it to the same Computer path that shows on your Anaconda Powershell prompt for your new virtual environment. . Run pip install with the TA-Lib file name, see picture below. . Pip Install all other required libraries like pandas, datetime, pandas_datareader. . . Step 2: Download required python libraries and data from Yahoo Finance . # import python libraries from pandas_datareader import data import numpy as np from datetime import datetime from datetime import date, timedelta import pandas as pd import talib . # Create Parameters Number_of_days = input(&#39;Enter Calendar days:&#39;) print(Number_of_days) Stock_Ticker = input(&#39;Enter Stock Ticker:&#39;) print(Stock_Ticker) Moving_Average = input(&#39;Enter Bollinger Bands Moving Average Type (Simple or Exponential): &#39;) if Moving_Average == &#39;Simple&#39;: print(Moving_Average) elif Moving_Average == &#39;Exponential&#39;: print(Moving_Average) else: print(&#39;error&#39;) Days = int(Number_of_days) . Enter Calendar days:740 740 Enter Stock Ticker:TQQQ TQQQ Enter Bollinger Bands Moving Average Type (Simple or Exponential): Simple Simple . # load stock data from yahoo start = date.today() - timedelta(Days) today = date.today() df = data.DataReader(Stock_Ticker, start=start, end=today, data_source=&#39;yahoo&#39;) .

            "content": "This purpose of this project was to create stock price movement charts with widgets for interactivity using the available python libraries. . Price Movement Charts . Price movement charts help with timing the market for buying or selling opportunities by determining up and down trends in price movement. These charts can typically be used with any financial time series like stocks, bonds, options, futures or commodities. . Renko . Is a type of price movement chart that has no time dimension. The key parameter it requires is the box size which signifies each brick (price movement size). The box size can be set to a specific value, or it be set to be equal to the ATR (average true range) which is derived from the closing price of the stock. With these charts its able to quickly tell the direction of trend changes. . PNF . PNF otherwise known as Point and Figure Chart is very similar to the renko chart, in that it also does not have a time dimension. An X represents when the price has moved higher, and an O represents when the price has dropped. The PNF also has a box size that can be set as a specific value, or be equal to the ATR (average true range). . OHLC . This is a type of price movement chart that captures the open, high, low and closing prices for each given trading day. . The vertical line represents the range in prices from high to low for the day. The horizontal lines extending out from the vertical line, represents open price for the left, and close price for the right. . Candlestick . Also known as Japanese candlesticks are a type of price movement chart that takes into consideration both price, time and volume. It helps to determine the sentiment of the market - Bullish or Bearish. Bullish - would indicate a buy, while Bearish - would indicate short or sell for a stock trader. . Candlestick patterns can help determine price direction and momentum. One key thing to note when using candlesticks to understand price movement, it is important to first identify the market trend, before finding candlestick patterns in the data. Candlestick patterns are also best suited for identifying short term price movements. . Long and short days . Long days refers to large price movement within the trading day, and short days refers to low price movement within the trading day. This comparison however is best suited for short-term price movement of about 5-10days. . Load required libraries .
